            <h4><b>Inspiration</b></h4>
               <p>&nbsp&nbsp In 2015 I became friends with a well known musician from the St. Louis area 
                who was living in Seattle.  He suggested that I get into Mobile App development,
                so I started thinking of ideas for an App.  
                I immediately thought that developing something that would play and 
                print exercises from two famous drumset books "Syncopation" and "The New Breed"
                would be a cool idea, but then realized that my first attempt should be less complicated.  
                I ended up deciding to create an app based on a famous snare drumming
                 book written in the 1930's called 'Stick Control', with additional functionality
                 to explore odd subdivisions and time signatures so that the 
                 app could create exercises that remind me of some of my favorite drummers and Tabla players.
                <br><br>
                I became obsessed with this thing and finally got it onto the Google Play Store in 2016.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp Google took it off the play store a few years ago because of missing policy documentation and/or SDK upgrades.  In 2025 I had a lot of time on my hands so I decided to resurrect it.
                With the help of Google's Gemini I was able to simplify the build process for the two product flavors "free" and "paid".
                I've had several arguments with Gemini, but I've learned a lot from it and more efficiently than sifting through StackOverflow posts like I did back in 2016.
                Working with AI has made me smarter and dumber at the same time.</p>
            <h4><b>Technologies used</b></h4>
            <h4><b>Java</b></h4>
            <p> All of the source code is written in Java.</p>
            <p>At one point I was trying to cross compile the FluidSynth C/C++ libraries to 3-5 different Android device architectures (x86,ARM, and a few others)
            to use its soundfont capabilities, but I ended up finding an easier way to accomplish the task 
            using a combination of JLayer encoding(A Java package) and Android's AudioTrack package.</p>
                
            <h4><b>XML</b></h4>
            <p>Used for the screen layouts.  It's very difficult for my brain to transition from Android XML layouts to HTML</p>
            <h4><b>The Build process(build.gradle file(Groovy))</b></h4>
            <p>I spent a large amount of time fighting with the various settings in the build files, and most notoriously the build.gradle Groovy files.
            Gemini helped me out a lot with this, but also led me in the wrong direction a few times.
             I feel that it might have been easier to accomplish this task back in 2016 when I was just relying on StackOverflow posts, but I did learn a ton about the build process this time from Gemini.
            </p>
                
            <h4><b>Firebase analytics, AdMob, Google Play Integrity</b></h4>
            <p>These are sort of like magic wands that provide amazing analytics dashboards once everything is connected properly.  
            I also had to integrate the Google Cloud Developer Play Integrity APIs with the settings for my app(s) in the Google Play Store</p>
