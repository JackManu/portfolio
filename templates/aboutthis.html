                    <b>Wikipedia/Youtube APIs</b>
                    <p>I set up API keys in the Wikipedia and Google API sites to enable connectivity.</p>
                    <p>Wikipedia APIs require an additional step to get an authentication token based on the API key (Curl command run through Python subprocess/check_output).  These tokens expire after 3 hours, I think, but I retrieve them every time.</p>
                    <p>The Python requests module is used to retrieve the json data from the sources</p>

                    <b>SQLite Database</b>   Currently very small/simple.

                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>Youtube Table</b>
                            <p>Information pertaining to a Youtube video.  The column 'wiki_id' ties it to the related entry in the Wikipedia table</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>view_counts Table</b>
                            <p>Entries are inserted to this when the user clicks to view a Wikipedia or Youtube link. This seemed to be the easiest bit of data that I could create some graphs with.</p>
                            <p>This table is only maintaining 7 days worth of data. The Python class for the graphs will perform the delete every time it is instantiated.</p>

                            <p>I added this in conjunction with better exception handling in the Python code.  Displaying the information is still in progress as of 2/16/2025.</p>

                    <p><b>Exception Handling</b>  I put a lot of energy into making sure that issues caught in try/except blocks would make their way to the screen using the 'error_modal.html'. so far, so good.  That modal window ends up popping up sometimes when I least expect it to and it makes troubleshooting very efficient. </p>

                <li>
                    <p><b>Graphs</b>  There are a lot of matplotlib graphing possibilities, but I'll need to collect more data points to make those relevant. My original idea for a graphing possibility was to somehow correlate related wikipedia/youtube videos to each other.  I'm currently only focusing on music related items so I was thinking that if I dig into the Wikipedia/Youtube APIs a bit more I can get the information needed to do some kind of Venn diagram of the relationships.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Database</b>  Maybe add functionality to support multiple databases and allow the user to choose and/or create a database.  I don't think it will be that difficult as long as filespace issues don't arise.  The functionality is already in place to create the database (scripts are in the cfg/.config file), and I think setting up a class variable for the current database being used is all that will be needed in addition to the HTML dropdown/etc.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Site Traffic</b>  I'm currently looking at the 'pusher' software to see what can be done with monitoring activities on this site.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Any Other Ideas??</b>  I'm always trying to think of something else to add. Any feedback is appreciated, especially negative feedback</p>
